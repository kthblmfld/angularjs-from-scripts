<h2>Walt's Passion</h2>
<p>
    The alchemy  of putting smart people together, each giving everything they have to give, and unaccountably,
    the total of their talent and hard work produces something remarkable, something enduring,
    something far greater than the sum of its parts.
    Chemistry. Magic. Even Love.

<p>
    Walt is kept alive by his many passions. Inherent is his passion for life, but he has also established a
    reputation for deadliness amongst the world's top pizza producers.
